# 2_Classical_Cryptanalysis

This repository contains Python implementations of classical cryptanalysis.

The methods in this repository such as letter frequencies and coincidence
indexes can be used to analyse any ciphertexts, however for modern ciphers,
such as RSA and elliptic curves, these techniques are insufficient.
